# MyAnimeList SQL Project
The objective of this project is to leverage SQL for a comprehensive exploration of the MyAnimeList dataset. Ultimately, I will be extracting meaningful insights and presenting them in an engaging and interactive dashboard on Tableau.

The analysis explores anime genres' impact on user engagement, uncovers seasonal trends in releases, assesses the performance of studios, and examines user engagement behavior in relation to anime popularity.
  
Through this all-around analysis, I aim to provide valuable insights for anime enthusiasts and stakeholders in the anime industry, offering a comprehensive understanding of the anime landscape today.
